Two halves, because they need different things. `lint` reads what the repository ships
— the scripts, the workflows, SKILL.md and the vendored copies — with the linters the
flake's dev shell pins: actionlint, shellcheck, shfmt. `behaviour` runs check-prose.sh
on the readme and the fixtures and needs only bash and POSIX tools, so it runs under the
bash 3.2 macOS ships, which is what check-prose.sh claims to run on. `all`, the default,
is both

  nix develop -c ./tests/check.sh
  /bin/bash ./tests/check.sh behaviour        # on a macOS runner, CHECK_BASH32=1

Nothing here reaches the network
Exit 0 when everything holds, 1 on a finding, 2 on a usage error
